- C Language History

    - Created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in early 70s
    - Widespread popularity in late 70s, grew along with Unix
    - Language definition in K&R allowed for ambiguity in compiler design
    - ANSI C ratified in 1989, C11 is latest



- Higher Level Languages

    - First Generation
        - Machine Language
        - Machine Instructions and Memory Locations

    - Second Generation
        - Assembly Language
        - Symbolic Names for Memory Locations
        - Assembler = Translates assembly language to machine instructions
        - Still low-level, not portable

    - Higher-Level Languages
        - Portable, don't worry about architecture of particular machine
        - FORTRAN
        - Compiler = Translates high-level language to machine instructions



- Compilation Process

    Source Program (file.c)
            |
            v    Compilation (C to assembly to binary code)
            |
            v
    Object File (file.o)
            |
            v    Link and create executable
            |
            v
    Executable (a.out)
